This was built to show a working implementation of ag-grid (a powerful javascript-based grid).  AG Grid is very powerful and configurable.  You just have to understand how to configure it.  It can be awesome, but also a real pain.  Make sure you do things the AG Grid way in order to be successful.  You will thank yourself later for doing so.
